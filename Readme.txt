== Description ==

Damn simple [markdown]#via shortcode[/markdown] for wordpress.
This plugin uses [parsedown](http://parsedown.org/) and [highlight.js](highlightjs.org). Zero configuration.

Write this into the editor:

    [markdown]  
    #h1  
    ##h2  
    text  
    ____source code (two ore more underscores will be replaced my empty spaces)  
    ____source code (two ore more underscores will be replaced my empty spaces)  
    
    ```javascript
    source code
    ```
    [/markdown]

and the shortcode content will be parsed with parsedown. Syntax highlighting will appear for the source codes.  

This plugin is available at [github](https://github.com/JohannesHoppe/markdown-shortcode), too.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the `markdown-shortcode` directory to the `/wp-content/plugins` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the plugins menu in WordPress.
3. Use it by wrapping text in the shortcode


== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Will it work in the Visual Editor? =

Yes. You can switch between Visual and Text(HTML) mode. The plugin converts html entities back to the original characters.

= The WYSIWYG editor (TinyMCE) is removing empty spaces! =

Indeed, TinyMCE is well-known for destroying markup. Replace empty spaces with underscores __ .
Underscores will be converted to empty spaces right before markdown conversion.
